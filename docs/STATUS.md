# Project status — the handoff file

The next agent starts here. **Edit only your own workstream's section** (so parallel agents never
conflict), and update it whenever you start, finish a slice, get blocked or stop. Keep entries short.
Status values: `open` · `in progress` · `blocked` · `review` · `done`.

**Tasks:** every section has a checklist in priority order. Take the first unchecked task that isn't
blocked, tick it (`[x]`) once it's merged to `main` and verified, and add tasks you discover at the
bottom of your own list. Scope and file ownership: [WORKSTREAMS.md](WORKSTREAMS.md).

## Critical path to the demo

1. **WS1** settings + workflow storage and `files.import` → the app keeps its state across restarts.
2. **WS7** mock LLM + **WS5** Raw on sample files + **WS1** executor → a flow runs end to end offline.
3. **WS3** Car tab on fixtures → can start **now**, in parallel.
4. **WS8** scoring + **WS7** AI Splitter / Add to Car → real, ranked requirements on the Car tab.
5. **WS6** web research, **WS4** packaging and icon, **WS2** run view and polish.

## What works right now (maintained by WS0)

- **App shell:** Electron desktop app with three tabs at the bottom, **Data Flow · Car · Settings**
  (⌘/Ctrl + 1–3), light and dark theme in the BMW M colorway. `npm run dev` to try it,
  `npm run smoke` to check it (drives the real app, screenshots in `apps/desktop/out/smoke/`).
- **Data Flow (structure):** Building Blocks palette (Custom, Raw, Research, AI Filter, AI Splitter,
  HIL, Add to Car), drag or click onto the workplace, connect ports (invalid connections and loops are
  refused with a reason), inspector with placeholder parameters, splitter branches and Add to Car
  rankings become ports, Custom/Research/AI Filter open into inner workplaces (breadcrumb back),
  delete with confirmation. The flow lives in memory: **not saved yet** and **nothing runs yet**.
- **HIL block (finalized):** double-click opens the review report: a flow chart of how the data was
  collected (lineage across inner workplaces) and a table icon on every step to see the data there
  (synthetic sample until flows run). Runtime logic (pause until reviewed, then pass on) is built and
  tested; it runs once the executor exists.
- **Raw block (built, WS5):** reads `.xlsx` (any sheet), CSV (`,` `;` tab, UTF-8 or Windows-1252, German
  number formats) and read-only SQLite queries into one source + one record per row, with
  deterministic usage findings from take rates and sales volumes. "Choose file…" opens the native
  dialog (`files.import`); "Preview data" in the inspector and the HIL report show the real parsed
  data (`blocks.preview`). Synthetic samples in `data/samples/`. Also reads BMW's real exports
  (feedback, customer studies, sales volumes; see the WS5 log for their shapes) when they're in
  `data/raw/`; the PDF option list is refused for now.
- **Car:** placeholder (car icon + global vehicle/market from Settings).
- **Settings:** App, Global parameters, AI & research, Collaboration, About. Changes are validated and
  apply live (theme, grid, minimap). **Not saved to disk yet** (`settings.save` is WS1).
- **Contract:** domain schemas, block specs (`core/src/blocks.ts`), graph rules (`core/src/graph.ts`),
  IPC API, scoring formula, synthetic F70 EU fixtures, block registry, default template.
  Built block implementations: Raw, HIL. **No executor or database exists yet**, so flows don't run.
  Built IPC methods: `app.info`, `templates.list`, `blocks.preview`, `files.import`; every other
  method answers `not_implemented`.
- Repo is public, and Entire is enabled (checkpoints are pushed with every `git push`).

## Open questions for the humans

- Demo scope: **1 Series (F70) · EU · 5 years** (decided 2026-10-10: BMW's data is for the F70).
  Today's F70 has combustion engines only. Should range and charging be in scope for the successor?
- BMW datasets: received 2026-10-10, local only in `data/raw/` (gitignored, also by file name).
  **Transcripts are public:** inspect them with scripts that print structure and counts, never values.

## WS0 — Lead / integrator

**Status:** in progress · **Owner:** Claude Code (setup session) · **Branch:** `main`

**Tasks**

- [ ] Review and merge PRs (merge commits, never squash); keep `main` green with `npm run check && npm run smoke`.
- [ ] Apply contract-change requests from the sections below (`packages/core`, block params and ports).
- [ ] Integration: run `BMW_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` end to end with the `mock` LLM, then with Claude and the real data.
- [ ] Demo script and rehearsal (PRODUCT.md → Demo scenario); keep PRODUCT.md and this file current.

**Log**

- 2026-10-10 night: Demo scope switched to the 1 Series F70 · EU (default settings, fixtures renamed to
  `sample-f70-eu.ts` with `REQ-F70-EU-…` ids, docs). `data/samples/` stays 5 Series on purpose: it
  tests the parser, and a second series shows the Raw block isn't tied to one car.
- 2026-10-10 night: Did WS5 (Raw block) in this session, see the WS5 section. Also built two WS1 pieces
  it needed: `files.import` with a file store (`packages/db/src/files.ts`) and `blocks.preview`.
- 2026-10-10 night: Finalized the HIL block (t/f/1/1): `core/src/lineage.ts` (`traceLineage`), review
  report UI (`components/dataflow/report/`), runtime in `packages/blocks/src/hil/hil.ts`. PRODUCT.md
  now lists every block's spec and state. Verify: `npm run check && npm run smoke`.
- 2026-10-10 late: Switched the visual system to the BMW M colorway (see ARCHITECTURE.md → Renderer state).
  Wrote ordered task lists for every workstream in this file.
- 2026-10-10 evening: Built the app structure from the team's sketch: bottom tabs, Data Flow editor
  (blocks, ports, inner workplaces), Settings page, Car placeholder. Replaced the node model with
  building blocks (ADR 0003): `@reqflow/nodes` → `@reqflow/blocks`, `nodes.catalog` removed,
  `runs.nodeOutput` → `runs.blockOutput`. Verify: `npm run check && npm run smoke`.
- 2026-10-10: Repo scaffolded, switched from web to Electron desktop app, made the repo public, enabled Entire.

## WS1 — Engine, persistence & main process

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Unblocks:** everyone. Do tasks 1–4 first; they are small and make the UIs real.

**Tasks**

- [ ] `settings.get` / `settings.save` in `apps/desktop/src/main/`: one JSON file in the data dir, written
      atomically (temp file + rename), validated with `Settings`; on load, fill sections missing from older
      files with `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`. Done when the Settings page's "not saved" banner disappears and a
      change survives a restart (add a test for the load/merge/save logic).
- [ ] `workflows.list/get/save/remove`: store the block tree; `save` assigns a `wf_…` id, bumps
      `version`, sets timestamps and rejects graphs where `validateGraph` reports issues
      (`invalid_input` with the issues as details).
- [x] `files.import()` + file store (`packages/db/src/files.ts`), done in the WS5 session: native
      dialog (`.xlsx`, `.csv`), copy into `<dataDir>/uploads/`, ids validated against path tricks.
- [x] `blocks.preview` (`apps/desktop/src/main/preview.ts`): runs a block without inputs on its own.
- [ ] Read-only `requirements.list/get` and `audit.list` serving `@reqflow/core/fixtures`, so WS3
      works against real IPC before the database exists.
- [ ] Executor in `packages/engine` (ARCHITECTURE.md → Engine semantics) with tests on fake blocks:
      topological order per workplace, merge per input port, splitter fan-out, inner workplaces via
      boundary blocks, failure → downstream `skipped`, cancel via `AbortSignal`.
- [x] HIL block implementation (`packages/blocks/src/hil/hil.ts`, done by WS0): pauses with a message, passes data on when `ctx.resumed`.
- [ ] Executor support for HIL: `{ status: "paused" }` → run `waiting_for_review`; `runs.resume` checks the
      required approvals and re-runs the block with `ctx.resumed = true`.
- [ ] `runs.start/get/list/blockOutput/resume/cancel` handlers; push every change via `IPC_EVENTS.runUpdate`;
      wire `BlockContext` (llm, web, files, audit, `car.add`).
- [ ] SQLite in `packages/db` (`node:sqlite`): versioned requirements, append-only audit log,
      `requirements.edit/decide`, `exports.requirements` (JSON / CSV / Markdown via the save dialog).
- [ ] API keys: `settings.secrets` / `settings.setSecret` with Electron `safeStorage`.
- [ ] Extend `apps/desktop/src/main/smoke.ts` for each new capability (e.g. save a flow, restart, reload it).

## WS2 — Data Flow editor UI

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** WS1 for save/load and runs. Tasks 1–3 can start now.

**Tasks**

- [ ] Undo / redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) in `components/dataflow/store.ts`: history of `root` snapshots, with tests.
- [ ] Copy / paste / duplicate blocks (⌘C / ⌘V / ⌘D): fresh ids for the block and everything in its
      inner workplace, edges between copied blocks kept; tests.
- [ ] "New from template": load `api.templates.list()` → `BMW_DEFAULT_TEMPLATE` onto the workplace
      (confirm before replacing a non-empty flow).
- [ ] Save, load and autosave with `api.workflows.*`; show unsaved changes; flow name in the header.
      Until WS1 lands, show the `not_implemented` state instead of failing silently.
- [ ] Problems view: run `validateGraph` plus "input not connected" / "Raw block has no file" checks and
      mark the affected blocks.
- [ ] Run button and live status on every block (`api.runs.start`, `api.runs.onUpdate`): status dot,
      counts, logs; a "waiting for review" banner linking to the Car tab. Mock with `fixtureRun` until WS1.
- [ ] Output inspector: click a finished block → `api.runs.blockOutput()` per port.
- [ ] HIL report with real data for steps that need a run: Raw steps already show their real data
      (`blocks.preview`); for the others, replace the "no run yet" state in
      `components/dataflow/report/DataPanel.tsx` with the step's data from the latest run (`api.runs.blockOutput`; for the HIL itself merge what
      its incoming edges carried with `mergePipelineData`). Keep the synthetic sample as an explicit option.
- [ ] Polish: "Tidy up" auto-layout, multi-select actions, minimap colours per block group.

**Log**

## WS3 — Car tab: requirements review & audit UI

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** nothing to start: build on `@reqflow/core/fixtures` (5 requirements, findings, sources,
audit events), then switch to `api.requirements.*` / `api.audit.list` as WS1 serves them.

**Tasks**

- [ ] Requirements on the Car tab, grouped by ranking (Must / Should / Could / Won't), with the car
      visual kept as the header; filters (category, status, evidence level) and sort by score.
- [ ] Requirement detail (drawer or route `/car/:id`): description, measurable targets, score breakdown
      (factor × weight with notes), priority and rationale, evidence level badge, assumptions,
      uncertainties, conflicting findings.
- [ ] Evidence drill-down: requirement → findings → verbatim excerpts → source (kind, reliability, link).
- [ ] Decision bar: approve / reject / defer / challenge, rationale required → `api.requirements.decide`.
- [ ] Inline edit with rationale → `api.requirements.edit`; version history per requirement.
- [ ] Audit timeline (global and per requirement) from `api.audit.list`, before → after diffs, filters.
- [ ] Export button → `api.exports.requirements` (JSON / CSV / Markdown).
- [ ] Add Car-tab steps to `npm run smoke` (propose the diff to WS1/WS0 in your log).

**Log**

## WS4 — Settings, app shell & packaging

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** WS1 for tasks 1–2.

**Tasks**

- [ ] Once WS1's `settings.save` lands: confirm settings survive a restart, remove dead "not saved" paths.
- [ ] API keys in Settings → AI & research: set, replace and remove via `api.settings.setSecret`; show
      only whether a key is configured, never the key.
- [ ] App icon in the M colorway (`apps/desktop/build/icon.icns`, `icon.ico`, `icon.png` 512 px).
- [ ] `npm run package` on macOS, Windows and Linux; fix what breaks; document install steps in README.
- [ ] Optional: GitHub Actions matrix (macOS, Windows, Ubuntu) running `npm run check` and
      `npm run smoke` (`xvfb-run` on Linux).
- [ ] Demo polish: keyboard-shortcut overview, consistent empty states, About screen with team names.

**Log**

## WS5 — Raw block (BMW data ingestion)

**Status:** review · **Owner:** Claude Code (lead session) · **Branch:** `main`
**Depends on:** nothing left; next real step needs BMW's files.

**Tasks**

- [x] Synthetic sample files in `data/samples/` (generator `generate.ts`, README with what each one tests).
- [x] Parser: `.xlsx` via `read-excel-file` (pinned 9.3.10), CSV via our own RFC 4180 reader
      (delimiter detection, BOM, Windows-1252 fallback); legacy `.xls` refused with a fix.
- [x] `raw` implementation (`packages/blocks/src/raw/raw.ts`): header detection, blank/duplicate
      columns renamed, empty rows skipped **and reported**, stray values fail naming the row,
      deterministic ids, output validated with `PipelineData`, audit events.
- [x] Usage findings: take rate ≥ 70 % / ≤ 15 % (equipment), volume change ≥ 10 % (sales), each
      citing its rows verbatim; thresholds are constants in `findings.ts`.
- [x] Database source: read-only SQLite, one SELECT only; other databases fail with a clear message.
- [x] BMW's data in `data/raw/`: feedback, studies and sales read correctly (shapes in the log);
      tests on the real files run locally when they're present (`raw.test.ts`, "BMW …" suites).
- [ ] F70 option list (PDF): needs a PDF table reader (e.g. pdfjs) in the Raw block, or BMW's
      list as Excel. Refused with a clear message until then.
- [ ] Customer study findings: per question, how the F70 scores against the other models in the
      same market (deterministic, like the take-rate findings), with the study rows as evidence.
- [ ] If BMW's headers can't be matched automatically: add an optional column-mapping param
      (contract change via WS0).
- [ ] Large exports (≈100k rows): measure preview time and IPC payload; page the preview if needed.
- [ ] PostgreSQL / SQL Server sources, if the demo needs them (credentials in the keychain, never in params).

**Log**

- 2026-10-10 night: Raw block built and verified: `npx vitest run packages/blocks` (23 tests on the
  samples, incl. SQLite) and `npm run smoke` (imports the samples, previews them over IPC, drives a
  SQLite Raw block through the UI and opens its data in the HIL report). Column synonyms are
  guesses until BMW's real files arrive.
- 2026-10-10 night: Adapted to BMW's real files (shapes only, no data here):
  - **Feedback** (`.xlsx`, one sheet): one row per (feedback × classification), so the same ID and
    comment repeat; the rows are merged into one record per ID, and the differing classification
    columns become lists. Comment column `Customer Feedback`, market `Country` (2-letter codes),
    texts in English.
  - **Customer studies** (`.xlsx`, one sheet per region): report layout. Title rows, a row of market
    labels over the vehicle columns, the first question in the header's first cell, then a title-only
    row per question with figure rows below. Read as a `Section` column + one record per figure row.
  - **Sales volumes** (`.xlsx`, one sheet per vehicle): one row per market, one `volume_<year>`
    column per year, including a future plan year. Read as one series per row; plan years are worded
    as plans.
  - **Option list**: PDF, not readable yet.
  - Also: PDFs are refused instead of being read as text; `FileStore.remove()`. Verify: `npm run check`
    (the "BMW …" suites run only where `data/raw/` has the files) and `npm run smoke` (previews them
    over IPC, then deletes the imported copies).

## WS6 — Research block

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** WS1 wires the providers into `ctx.web`; everything below can start now.

**Tasks**

- [ ] `WebSearch` providers in `packages/blocks/src/research/`: `anthropic_web_search` and `tavily`,
      as factories that take the key as an argument (never read env vars).
- [ ] Query builder from the block's params and the scope (competitors in the segment, owner and press
      reviews, market and technology trends for the horizon).
- [ ] Fetch pages and extract clean text into `SourceRecord`s; `Source` with kind, publisher, date and
      reliability (document the rule).
- [ ] Respect allowed / blocked domains and `maxResults`, de-duplicate by URL, log failures.
- [ ] Recorded fixtures so `npm test` runs offline (no live network in tests).

**Log**

## WS7 — AI blocks: AI Filter, AI Splitter, Add to Car

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** nothing for tasks 1–2; WS8 for the splitter's priority mode.

**Tasks**

- [ ] `packages/llm`: `createLlmClient(settings.llm, { apiKey })` with an `anthropic` provider (use the
      `claude-api` skill) and a deterministic `mock`; `generateObject` validates with Zod; tests use the mock.
- [ ] AI Filter: keep items matching the criterion, extract findings with verbatim-excerpt
      verification, log every excluded item with a reason.
- [ ] AI Splitter: route each item to exactly one branch (`out-<i>`); "priority" uses WS8's scoring,
      "category" / "sentiment" / "custom" use the LLM.
- [ ] Add to Car: cluster and derive requirements (IDs via `formatRequirementId`, targets, evidence level
      A–D, Kano class, assumptions, uncertainties, conflicts), priority from the input port, hand them to `ctx.car.add`.
- [ ] `answerChallenge(...)` for the Car tab's challenge flow.
- [ ] End-to-end offline test: fixture records → AI Filter → AI Splitter → Add to Car with `mock`.

**Log**

## WS8 — Prioritization

**Status:** open · **Owner:** — · **Branch:** —
**Depends on:** nothing; agree the function signature with WS7 in your log.

**Tasks**

- [ ] Deterministic factors in `packages/blocks/src/prioritization/`: customer impact, evidence
      strength, competitive gap, trend momentum, each with a one-line note.
- [ ] LLM-judged factors (brand fit, ease) behind `LlmClient`, one-line note each; mock in tests.
- [ ] `priorityRationale` naming the top drivers; flag "high score, weak evidence".
- [ ] Tests: reproducible scores on the fixtures; changing Settings weights changes the ranking as expected.
- [ ] Export the function the AI Splitter's priority mode calls (`weightedTotal` + `priorityForScore`).
